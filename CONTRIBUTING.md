# Contributing to OpenMango

Thanks for your interest in contributing! This guide will help you get set up and submit your first PR.

## Prerequisites

- **Rust** (stable toolchain)
- **[just](https://github.com/casey/just)** — command runner
- **MongoDB** — local instance or remote connection for manual testing
- **Docker** — required for integration tests (Testcontainers)
- **[Bun](https://bun.sh)** — for the Forge shell sidecar (`tools/forge-sidecar/`)
- **Xcode 26 or newer** on macOS — for app icon compilation, packaging, and `just ci-macos`

For Linux dependencies, AppImage packaging, and desktop checks, see
[Linux development](docs/LINUX.md). Keep Linux build output in a separate target
directory when sharing a checkout with macOS. For the Windows toolchain and installer,
see [Windows development](docs/WINDOWS.md).

## Getting Started

```sh
git clone https://github.com/ggagosh/openmango.git
cd openmango
just dev
```

This compiles and launches the app in development mode. No `.env` file is required. Use
`just debug` to start with `RUST_LOG=debug`.

The repository includes the Apple Silicon helper binaries used by normal local development.
Rebuild or download them for your host when working on Forge or BSON transfer support:

```sh
just build-sidecar
just download-tools
```

### macOS signing

The Cargo runner signs development builds with an Apple Development identity and a stable
app-and-team requirement. Unchanged, valid builds are not signed again. Set
`OPENMANGO_DEV_SIGNING_IDENTITY` to a full identity name or SHA-1 to select a different Apple
signing identity; the runner stops if no matching identity is available instead of launching
an unsigned app.

Keychain items approved for older unsigned builds or an older certificate may need one
approval for the corrected development signature. Approve the signing key and each requested
OpenMango item with **Always Allow** in the macOS dialogs. Credentials remain in Keychain;
development does not fall back to a plaintext file.

## Development Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|------------|
| `just dev` | Run in development mode |
| `just debug` | Run with `RUST_LOG=debug` |
| `just check` | Fast compile verification |
| `just lint` | Clippy with `-D warnings` |
| `just fmt-check` | Check formatting |
| `just unit-test` | Run library tests serially |
| `just test` | Run all tests |
| `just ci` | Common CI checks: formatting, release Clippy, sidecar bundle, and unit tests |
| `just ci-macos` | Common checks plus macOS icon compilation |
| `just precommit` | Run `just ci` followed by the full test suite |
| `just app-icon` | Compile the native macOS app icon and PNG export |
| `just bootstrap-linux` | Install Ubuntu/Debian build dependencies inside Linux |
| `just package-linux` | Build the native Linux AppImage and bundled tools |
| `just package-windows` | Build the native Windows installer and bundled tools |

Always use `just` commands rather than calling `cargo` directly.

```

## Coding Standards

- **Formatter:** `rustfmt` with `max_width = 100`
- **Linter:** Clippy with warnings denied — all code must be clippy-clean
- **Naming:** `snake_case` for functions/modules, `PascalCase` for types/traits, `SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE` for constants
- **Organization:** Keep logic in domain folders (`state/commands/*`, `connection/ops/*`) rather than growing large mixed modules

## Testing

**Unit tests:**

```sh
just test
```

**Integration tests** (requires Docker):

```sh
cargo test --test transfer_tests -- --test-threads=1
```

Integration suites under `tests/` use [Testcontainers](https://testcontainers.com) to spin up MongoDB instances automatically.

Add or extend tests whenever you change behavior. PRs without relevant test coverage may be asked to add it.

## Pull Request Process

1. **Before opening a PR**, run the full local CI check:

   ```sh
   just ci
   ```

2. **PR description** should include:
   - What the change does and why
   - Linked issue (if applicable)
   - Test commands you ran
   - Screenshots for any UI changes

3. **Commit style:** short imperative subjects (e.g., `fix srv error`, `add changelog`)

## Releasing

Releases are cut from `main` in two steps:

1. `just prepare-release 0.2.2` bumps `Cargo.toml` and `Cargo.lock`, moves the CHANGELOG `[Unreleased]` entries under `[0.2.2]`, and opens a `release 0.2.2` pull request.
2. After that pull request merges, `just tag-release 0.2.2` tags `main` and pushes `v0.2.2`.

The tag starts the Release workflow: it checks that the tag matches `Cargo.toml`, builds and signs the macOS, Linux, and Windows packages, and publishes one GitHub release with the CHANGELOG section as its notes. Nightly builds publish automatically from every push to `main`.

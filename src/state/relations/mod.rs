//! The relation graph: which field points at which collection.
//!
//! MongoDB declares no foreign keys, so this is the one place that records them. Navigation,
//! "find references", `$lookup` generation, the integrity report and the agent tools all read
//! the same graph, and every one of them is a plain query over [`RelationGraph`].
//!
//! Relations are keyed by **database name, not connection**: "`orders.userId` points at `users`"
//! is a fact about the application's schema, and the dev, staging and production copies of one
//! app share it. Learning it locally means it is already there against production, without
//! running inference there. A wrong entry from two unrelated apps sharing a database name heals
//! itself, because every jump is still confirmed by a probe.

//! Conversation memory that survives a restart.
//!
//! rig defines the interface and the trimming policies but ships no persistent store, so this is
//! ours: one SQLite file beside the app's other local data.
//!
//! Two decisions shape it. First, what is kept: the dialogue, never the tool results. A
//! `find_documents` result is a copy of production rows, and keeping those on disk would turn a
//! chat log into a durable extract of the user's database — so tool calls and their results are
//! dropped on the way in, and the model re-runs a query when it needs the rows again.
//!
//! Second, how it is kept: the file is a SQLCipher database, encrypted whole — pages, indexes,
//! journals and WAL — with a key held in the OS keychain. That is the shape desktop applications
//! settle on (Signal Desktop is the reference), and it covers the table names, row counts and
//! timestamps that encrypting each row on its own would leave in the clear. Temporary files are
//! held in memory so no page is spilled to disk unencrypted.

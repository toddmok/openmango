# Relations — implementation plan

Planned 2026-09-20 from `OpenMango-Relations-Feature.pdf`, cross-checked against `src/`,
gpui-kit 0.6.2 (`refs/gpui-kit`), the Compass feedback thread, and competing clients.

**Decisions so far:** one build, not three releases. ObjectId references only. The relation graph
is written from scratch here (no external reference implementation).

## 1. Verdict on the feature doc

The direction is right. Three things change:

1. **The tab model cannot do what §3 describes.** `TabKey::Collection(SessionKey)` with
   `SessionKey = (connection, database, collection)` means one session per collection, so a jump to
   `users` would overwrite an open `users` tab. Fixed by the browser model in §4, which lands first.
2. **The §7 data structure is premature.** Arenas, `u32` ids, interning, hot/cold split and
   `arc-swap` are benchmarked at 464k paths; the doc itself says a typical database loads in a
   millisecond. Keep the **on-disk format**, use plain structs in memory (§5).
3. **Plain-hover peek is wrong for a dense grid and for production.** It runs queries without
   intent (§6).

The rest holds. The statistics are correct (rule of three: containment ≥ 1 − 3/k at 95%) and the
`$sample` random-cursor conditions match MongoDB's documented behaviour.

## 2. What users actually asked for

Compass idea CUSTOMER-I-6695, "Allow following a referenced ObjectID to the associated document":
created 2022-07-28, still *Submitted*, **7 votes, 3 comments**. Long-standing, not loud. The
comments are the useful part:

| User said | Requirement |
| --- | --- |
| "as easy as clicking a link on a web page" | Link affordance; one gesture; **browser mental model** |
| "finding the collection the ObjectID is in (which luckily I know, but if I didn't it would be even harder)" | Resolve the target for the user — value-based probe, zero setup |
| "right-click should open a context menu with a list of the DB's collections … opens another tab … with the `{_id: ObjectId("")}` query filled in and submitted" | Manual target pick; new-tab variant; real, visible filter |
| "double clicking the ObjectId switches to editing … most of the time I'm trying to select the text" | Do not steal click / double-click; copying an id stays trivial |

Competitors: **Mongon** — every ObjectId is a link, opens a new tab, "detects which collection the
ID belongs to" (click-time probing, no model). **NoSQLBooster** — "Follow Reference" in the context
menu, Shift+F7. **Compass** — no click-through, but now ships ER diagrams with inferred
relationships and export. Nobody ships visible evidence, referenced-by, or a shared model.

## 3. Cross-check: what already exists

| Doc needs | In the codebase | Gap |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Observed profile | `build_schema_analysis` (`state/commands/schema.rs`), `SchemaAnalysis` types | Reuse, do not write a second profiler. Paths are `items.[*].x` not `items[].x`; arrays-in-arrays not recursed; fixed 1000-doc sample; raw values not retained |
| `$sample` + `maxTimeMS` | `sample_for_schema_async` | None |
| Indexes, collStats | `list_indexes_async`, `collection_stats_async` | None |
| Fetch by `_id` | `find_document_by_id` | New op: bounded multi-collection `_id` probe |
| Real, editable filter on the target | `AppState::set_filter(key, raw, doc)`; fast filter parses bare ObjectIds | None once §4 lands |
| Context-menu entry point | `tree/tree_menus.rs`: "Filter by this value" / "Exclude this value" | Add items beside them |
| Model file | `ConfigManager` JSON files | Add `relations.json` |
| Environment awareness | `SavedConnection.environment`, `.protected`, `.read_only` | Gate unindexed / background reads |
| Agent tools | `src/ai/tools/*.rs` (one file per tool), `src/mcp/` | Two more files |
| DBRef | Nothing | Detect `{ $ref, $id, $db? }` sub-documents |
| Back / forward | Nothing; `cmd-[`, `cmd-]`, `cmd-b`, `f12` unbound | §4 |
| Document detail panel | Does not exist | References tab instead (§6) |
| Peek and trail widgets | gpui-kit `Popover`, `HoverCard`, `Breadcrumb`, `DescriptionList`, `Skeleton`, `Tag`, `Kbd` | None |
| Diagram view | gpui-kit has `chart` / `plot` only | Custom canvas + layout crate |
| Cmd-hover link state | gpui `on_modifiers_changed` | None |

**Cmd+click conflict.** Tree: Cmd+click toggles multi-select only on document root rows, so value
rows are free. Table: `render_tr` toggles selection anywhere in the row — the reference *text* in
`render_cell` must handle Cmd+mouse-down and stop propagation (`render_cell` needs a callback
parameter; it has no listener context today).

## 4. Tabs become browser tabs (lands first, own PR)

The Compass commenter's phrase is the design: "like clicking a link on a web page". Everyone
already knows that model — follow a link in the same tab, Back returns exactly where you were,
modifier-click opens a new tab, and no *other* tab is ever disturbed. Anything that rewrites a tab
the user is not looking at breaks the expectation that tabs are their working contexts.

- `SessionKey` gains `instance: u32` from a counter on `AppState`. A session is one view of a
  collection; several can exist per collection.
- Each collection tab owns `history: Vec<SessionKey>` plus a cursor.
  **Cmd+click navigates in place**: a new session for the target becomes the tab's current key and
  the previous session **stays alive** in history. Back therefore restores page, scroll,
  selection, expansion and filter for free — nothing is rebuilt or re-queried.
- Cap history at 20 per tab; sessions that fall off go through the existing `cleanup_session`.
  New jump truncates forward entries. Closing the tab cleans up its whole history.
- **Cmd+Shift+click** opens the target in a new tab.
- Current tab has unsaved edits → the jump opens a new tab instead. A dirty session is never
  buried in history where closing the tab would silently drop it.
- Sidebar click keeps today's behaviour (focus the tab whose current collection matches); a new
  "Open in new tab" gives a second view — the same context-menu item Compass has had since
  1.31, so it is familiar rather than invented. It has value on its own: comparing two filters
  of one collection is impossible today.

Blast radius, measured: `SessionKey` appears 473 times in 83 files, but only **42 construction
sites in 17 files** need a decision; the rest pass keys through unchanged. `WorkspaceTab` already
persists per tab, so the saved format already allows duplicates. Two caches are per *collection*,
not per view, and must be re-keyed by namespace: `collection_meta` and `forge_schema`
(`app_state/mod.rs`). `matches_collection`, `close_tabs_for_collection` and
`rename_collection_keys` must match every instance of a namespace.

## 5. Model and resolution

### Scope: ObjectId only

- Links: ObjectId values at any path except the root `_id`, and DBRef sub-documents whose `$id` is
  an ObjectId.
- Inference candidates: paths whose sampled values are ≥ 90% ObjectId. Targets: `_id` only.
- Dropped for now: unique-index targets, integer / string / UUID keys, ids-as-object-keys,
  compound keys. The file format still writes `target.path`, so none of this is a migration later.
- Known first follow-up: 24-hex **strings** that point at ObjectId `_id`s. Common in real schemas;
  out of this build.

ObjectId-only removes most ambiguity: ObjectIds are near-globally unique, so a probe hit is
near-proof. Ambiguity survives only in the rare shared-`_id` case (`users` / `user_profiles`),
and then there are at most a handful of *single* documents to choose between — a popover, not
a tab. The References view answers a different question: what points **at** this document, which
is many documents from many collections.

### In memory: plain structs

```rust
pub struct Relation {
    pub source: FieldRef,           // db, collection, path ("items[].productId")
    pub target: FieldRef,           // path is "_id" for now
    pub kind: RelationKind,         // Reference | Polymorphic | Embedded
    pub cardinality: Cardinality,
    pub origin: Origin,             // Inferred < Probe < CodeImport < DbRef < User
    pub status: Status,             // Candidate | Accepted | Rejected
    pub confidence: f32,
    pub evidence: Option<Evidence>, // sample size, hits, sampled_at
}
// ponytail: Vec<Relation> + HashMap indexes (outgoing by path, incoming by collection, outgoing by
// collection). Arena ids / interning / arc-swap only if a 2k-collection deployment shows up in a
// profile. join_path is a BFS over <100 nodes; no petgraph.
```

API as in the doc: `outgoing(path, min_conf)`, `referenced_by(coll, min_conf)`, `join_path(a, b)`,
`mongo_path()` (dot path + unwind count), `to_model()`. `upsert` is idempotent on
(source, target, kind) and never lets a lower origin overwrite a higher one. No `arc-swap`:
inference hands its result to the entity on the main thread, as schema analysis does now.

`Probe` is an origin the doc lacks: a mapping learned from a successful click. It is how the graph
fills itself in through ordinary use.

### On disk

`relations.json` via `ConfigManager`: versioned, string keys (`"shop.orders:items[].productId"`),
sorted for clean diffs. Export / import of the same format for sharing in git.

**Keyed by database name, not by connection.** A relation such as "`orders.userId` → `users`" is a
fact about the application's schema, and dev, staging and prod of one app share that schema. Learn
it on local dev, and it is already there when connecting to production — without running inference
on production. If two unrelated apps happen to share a database name, the wrong entry heals
itself: every jump is confirmed by a probe, a miss falls through to the search, and the new hit
replaces the stale mapping.

### Click-time resolve

1. DBRef → target is explicit.
2. Relation exists → `find_one({_id: v})` on the target: existence check and peek payload in one
   query. Miss → broken-reference state.
3. None → rank same-database collections by name (`userId`, `user_id`, `user`, `ownerIds[]` →
   strip the id suffix, singular / plural match), probe with covered `find({_id: v}, {_id: 1})`,
   concurrency 8, `maxTimeMS` 2000. Above ~200 collections probe the top 50, offer "Search all".
   One hit → navigate and remember. Several → the peek popover in choose mode, one row per
   collection holding the id, "Remember for `orders.userId`" checked. None → "No document with
   this `_id` in any collection of `shop`" + pick a collection.

Value-first probing resolves polymorphic references (`refPath`) for free. Click-time probes use
the connection's own read preference; `secondaryPreferred` is a per-operation setting for
background inference only.

## 6. UI / UX

Lens: PRODUCT.md, better-ui, and the emil-design-eng frequency rule — this happens tens to hundreds
of times a day, so almost nothing here animates.

### Gestures

| Input | Result |
| --- | --- |
| Click / double-click | Unchanged: select / edit |
| Cmd+click on a reference | Navigate in this tab |
| Cmd+click on a document's `_id` | Find what references it — the same gesture, asked inward |
| Cmd+Shift+click | Navigate in a new tab |
| Cmd held | References get underline + pointer cursor |
| Row hover | Small arrow after the value; click = peek |
| `cmd-b` (also `f12`) | Navigate from the selected row |
| `space` on a selected reference row | Peek |
| `cmd-[` / `cmd-]` | Back / forward in this tab |
| Context menu | "Go to referenced document", "Find in collection ▸", "Open all" (arrays), "Find references to this document" (root rows) |

### Peek

- **Triggers: arrow click, `space`, or Cmd+hover. Never plain hover** — accidental cards, and
  unintended reads on production. Cmd+hover is VS Code's definition preview. `HoverCard` (with its
  open delay) for Cmd+hover only; `Popover` otherwise.
- Header: target namespace + connection / environment chip. Body: first ~8 top-level scalar fields
  as a `DescriptionList` in the existing BSON colors. Footer: `Open` (Enter), `Open in new tab`
  (Cmd+Enter), with `Kbd` hints.
- `Skeleton` rows only after ~150 ms, so a 20 ms local probe never flashes a loader.
- Esc closes and restores focus to the originating row.

### Motion

| Element | Decision | Why |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Hover arrow, Cmd-underline | Instant | Constant in a grid; state cue, not decoration |
| Peek by pointer | gpui-kit `MotionTokens` popover enter, origin at the trigger, scale never below ~0.97 | Match the kit; popovers grow from their trigger |
| Peek by keyboard | None | Never animate keyboard-initiated actions |
| Peek exit | Faster than enter, or instant | The system responding should be snappy |
| Navigate / back / forward | Instant swap, no slide | Ornamental motion is a PRODUCT.md anti-reference |
| "N relations found" badge | Opacity-only fade, once | Rare; movement would compete with data |
| Reduced motion | Opacity only | PRODUCT.md |

### Details that compound

- A jump that returns exactly one document **expands it** in tree view.
- Link affordance is underline + arrow, never color alone. The arrow points right on a
  reference and left on an `_id`, because the jump each one offers goes the opposite way. Broken reference is icon + sentence,
  neutral tone, two actions ("Search other collections", "Edit relation"). "Unindexed" on a
  References group is an icon **and** a label.
- Peek radius is concentric (inner = popover radius − padding) from existing tokens; elevation from
  the kit's popover shadow, no extra border.
- Breadcrumb renders the tab's history only when depth > 1, truncates in the middle
  (`users › … › products`), every crumb is a button, and it takes no space when hidden.

### References view

Zed's answer to "what points at this?" is not a list of counts but a multibuffer: one tab holding
the actual matches from every file. The same shape fits here and replaces the earlier popover
idea: seeing the twelve orders beats seeing "`orders.userId` · 12" and clicking through.

- **Its own tab kind**, `TabKey::References`, with state in a map keyed by id — the pattern
  Transfer and Forge tabs already use. Title: "References to `users` / 64f…". It opens as a new
  tab and never touches the tab it came from. No in-tab history: it is a result, and re-runnable.
- **Opened by** "Find references to this document" on a document root row, or `shift-f12`
  (VS Code's Go to References, the natural pair to `f12`).
- **Content**: one group per incoming edge from `referenced_by(collection)`. Group header:
  `orders.userId` · count · "indexed" / "unindexed — may be slow", plus **Open as filter**, which
  opens `orders` in a collection tab with the real filter `{ userId: ObjectId(…) }`. Under it,
  the first 20 matching documents as read-only rows; Enter on a row opens that document in its
  collection, filtered by `_id`.
- **Rendering is reuse, not new code**: `AggregationTableDelegate::refresh_data(Vec<Document>)`
  and the aggregation results view already draw an arbitrary document list as tree or table
  with read-only rows (`render_lazy_readonly_row`).
- **Loading**: groups load lazily and independently with `limit` + `maxTimeMS`, so one slow
  collection never blocks the rest. An unindexed group on a production / protected connection
  does not run by itself: its body is a "Run anyway" button.
- Tabular numerals for the counts, so lazy results do not jitter the headers.

The peek popover stays for the common single-target jump: a glance should not cost a tab.

### Relations page

Table of edges: source → target, kind, cardinality, origin, status, confidence, sample size and
age. Accept / reject / edit inline. **"Infer relations"** is an explicit button; automatic
inference on collection open is an opt-in setting, because unrequested background reads on
production contradict the product's trust stance. Drift on accepted edges shows here and in the
integrity report only — never as a toast.

## 7. Build order (one build)

Ordered by dependency; each step leaves the app working.

1. ~~**Tab refactor** (§4): session instances, per-tab history, back / forward, "Open in new
   tab".~~ **Done** on `feat/relations-tab-history`. `SessionKey` gained `instance`;
   `CollectionKey` now keys the per-collection caches; `state/app_state/tabs/navigation.rs`
   holds `navigate_to_collection` / `navigate_back` / `navigate_forward` /
   `open_collection_in_new_tab` / `navigation_trail`; `cmd-[` / `cmd-]` and
   `cmd-shift-enter` are bound. Navigation history is per-run and not persisted.
2. ~~**Relation graph**~~ **Done** — `src/state/relations/mod.rs`: structs, indexes, `outgoing` / `referenced_by` /
   `join_path` / `mongo_path` / `to_model`, path helper, name heuristic, `relations.json`.
   Unit tests: nested paths and unwind counts, join finding including misses, origin precedence,
   decision persistence, JSON round-trip and sort stability.
3. **Navigation** — mostly done. `connection/ops/relations.rs` probe op; `resolve()`; links in `tree_row.rs` and
   `cell_renderer.rs`; context menu; key bindings; peek; the References tab shell
   (`TabKey::References`, reusing the aggregation results rendering), first used for ambiguous
   targets; broken-reference state; breadcrumb; single-result expand.
   `tests/relations_tests.rs` (Testcontainers): resolve → probe → remembered relation,
   shared-`_id` ambiguity, miss, DBRef.
4. **Inference** — done. Run it for a whole database from the **Relations** section of the
   database tab (known count, progress, Stop), or for one collection from its context menu.
   `state/relations/infer.rs` profiles a byte-budgeted sample for ObjectId-shaped paths
   (arrays at any depth, ≤ 200 distinct ids each), reads DBRefs outright, pairs each field with
   the 8 best-named collections and confirms with covered `$in` probes escalating 10 → 50 → 200.
   Confidence is the share of probed ids that were found — it answers *which collection*, and
   the rule-of-three bound on containment stays in the evidence for the integrity report. A field
   keeps only its strongest target, ties broken by name.
   **Deferred, with the ceiling named in code:** the `_id` time-range prune and the `collStats`
   metadata stage it needs (name ranking already cuts the probe count); `secondaryPreferred` on
   inference reads; a job runner with pause / resume for whole-deployment sweeps; automatic
   inference on collection open.
5. **Surfaces** — References tab done: `TabKey::References`, "Find references" on a document
   (`shift-f12`), one group per incoming relation loading independently, unindexed groups held
   behind "Run anyway" on production and protected connections, "Open as filter" per group.
   A review *list* was built and then cut: two surfaces for one subject, and a table is a poor
   way to see a graph. Reading and deciding both belong on the canvas (step 7), and now do.
   Also done: links in aggregation results, tree and table, followed but never learned from,
   since a pipeline's output path is not a field of the collection; "Open all" on an array of
   ids; and a chip beside the collection name that says whether the database has been read for
   relations (click to infer), is being read, or has N relations here with M new (click to
   open the canvas holding this collection). When a database was last read in full is recorded
   in `relations.json`, because an empty graph cannot tell never-read from read-and-empty.
6. **Consumers on the graph** — done, all reading one module (`state/relations/export.rs`) so
   they cannot disagree about what is known or in what order.
   - **Agent and MCP tools:** `get_relations` and `join_path` (`openmango_` prefixed over MCP).
     The graph goes out as a line per collection with fields grouped under their target,
     `orders: users<buyerId,sellerId; products<items[].productId`: a thirteenth of the same
     facts as JSON on a real 113-relation database, about a thousand tokens for everything and a
     couple of hundred characters for one collection. Over MCP it is only given for a database
     the shared connection actually has, since relations are kept per database name.
   - **`$lookup` generation:** `join_path` to stages, named the way Mongoose's `populate` names
     them (`userId` to `user`, `createdBy` stays `createdBy`), a to-one step unwound with empty
     results kept, a later step reading through the name before it. Offered in the Add stage
     picker as "Join a related collection" (inserted as one undo step), and as "From relation"
     on a `$lookup` stage, which fills in all four fields. The stage editor has no text
     completion engine, so this is what completing a `$lookup` means here.
   - **Mermaid / DBML:** copied from the Relations tab's toolbar.
   Not done: a generative-UI block for relations in chat. Tool results are plain text today; the
   candidate is a small neighbourhood card with "Open canvas", worth it once the tools have
   been used enough to know what people ask them.
7. **The Relations tab** — done: the canvas. `TabKey::Relations`, one tab per database, opened
   from "Open canvas" in the database tab. It is the home for everything about a database's
   graph, so the integrity report and the Mermaid / DBML export join it rather than getting
   surfaces of their own.
   - **Layout** (`state/relations/layout.rs`): the standard layered method (Sugiyama, as in
     Graphviz `dot`, dagre and ELK), through `dugong`, a Rust port of dagre. Network-simplex
     ranking, crossing minimisation, Brandes–Köpf placement, and a lane for every long edge so it
     runs between cards rather than beneath them. On top of that: one routed trunk per pair of
     collections with each field's edge leaving its own row, and B-spline paths as cubic
     segments. A hand-written layered layout came first and was replaced: compared on a real
     19-collection, 113-edge graph, its edges ran under cards and its drawing was a 4:1 strip.
     `rust-sugiyama` was also tried and returns no edge routes. About 5ms, cached.
   - **Drawing** (`views/relations.rs`): cards are elements, edges are stroked cubic beziers via
     `PathBuilder` + `paint_path`. GPUI has **no element transform**, so zoom is applied to every
     computed coordinate and size.
   - **Performance by construction:** layout cached on the graph's fingerprint; cards and edges
     culled to the window; cards carry no listeners (the surface hit-tests the layout); text is
     not laid out below a legible zoom; dashes, the one costly stroke, only on edges in focus.
   - Pan by drag or scroll, zoom by pinch / cmd-scroll / `=` `-` `0`. Point at a collection to
     light everything joined to it, or at a field to light its one line and the collection at
     the far end; click to hold that, click again or Escape to let go. Held beats hovered, so a
     line can be followed across the canvas. The toolbar names what is lit. Double-click opens
     the collection.
   - No review panel. An accept / reject inspector was built and removed: a relation here is
     what the data says, confirmed by probing, so there was nothing for a person to rule on.
     `Status` stays in the model because navigation and older files use it.
   - A rank too tall to read folds into columns whose edges share a bus (junction nodes in the
     layout graph), in both directions: many sources into a hub, or one collection out to many
     lookups. The columns still step diagonally rather than sitting level, because the engine
     places each junction at the end of the neighbouring rank.
   Mermaid and DBML are copied from its toolbar. **Left in this tab:** the integrity report
   (orphans, unindexed reference fields), deferred. Not done: dragging cards, and levelling the
   columns of a folded rank.

8. **Independent consumers** — codegen (TypeScript / Zod / Rust), and code imports (Mongoose
   `ref`, Prisma, `$jsonSchema`) if wanted: a generic "point at a repo" reader, not a
   schema-specific one. Last because nothing depends on them.

New crates: `dugong` (and its `dugong-graphlib`), pinned exactly since it is an alpha. All use
is in `state/relations/layout.rs`.

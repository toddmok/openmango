# Changelog

All notable changes to OpenMango will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/).

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- Open a highlighted collection in Forge with Cmd/Ctrl+Shift+F, or choose Open Forge as the collection double-click action in Settings; queries start with `find({})`, ready to run ([#12](https://github.com/ggagosh/openmango/issues/12))
- Authenticated local MCP agent access with per-connection sharing and write controls, bounded read tools, direct document insert/update/replace/delete, and metadata-only History restore tools
- Native approval and Agent Activity workflows for Arcula database backups, syncs, and verified-backup reverts, including progress, cancellation, target fingerprints, and recovery interlocks
- Encrypted passive document History with change-stream capture, visible coverage gaps, retention controls, concise batch details, and conflict-safe resumable restores
- Saved-query descriptions, tags, global scope, and bounded versioned JSON import/export with atomic persistence and credential screening
- Explicit Development, Staging, and Production connection identity across the workspace, with optional fail-closed confirmation for Production writes and Forge execution
- Complete keyboard and command-palette coverage for Schema, Transfer and its query editor, Forge, document/index/aggregation workflows, tabs, and focus navigation, with a visible palette button
- Customizable keyboard shortcuts with search, context-aware conflict validation, recording, disable/reset controls, persisted overrides, and restart-safe application
- Query Library for Documents, Aggregation, and Forge with successful-run history, saved queries, full-text search, restore/run/copy/update/delete actions, keyboard access, atomic local persistence, and credential-aware exclusion
- Optional connection colors that accent connections in the sidebar, connection manager, and tabs, and survive connection import/export
- Shared unsaved-change protection across tabs, detached editors, connection changes, workspace restore, app quit, theme restart, and updater relaunch
- Query failures now stay visible per tab with Retry and Copy Details actions while preserving the last successful result
- Configurable `maxTimeMS` and real cancellation for interactive document queries
- Settings now show the log location and can export a redacted support bundle with runtime diagnostics
- AI privacy controls for selected-document and automatic sample sharing, both disabled by default
- Keyboard-operable app buttons with focus rings and Enter, Return, and Space activation
- Accessibility QA documentation and focus restoration for searches and confirmation dialogs
- Table view for documents — browse collections in a spreadsheet-style grid with sortable, resizable, and pinnable columns
- Per-page selector in the pagination bar — choose between 10, 25, 50, or 100 documents per page
- Islands tab style — choose between Islands, Segmented, or Underline tab appearance in Settings
- Tab icons — every tab now shows an icon for its content type (collection, database, forge, settings, etc.)
- Icons in context menus throughout the app (document actions, connection menu, field operations)
- AI sample_values tool — the AI assistant can now inspect real field values to give better answers
- Column pinning — pin frequently-used columns to the left so they stay visible while scrolling
- Fast collection filters — type compact filters like `status:active age>30` instead of writing full MongoDB JSON
- Smart filter value conversion — ObjectId fields accept bare 24-character IDs, and date fields accept shortcuts like `today`, `last7d`, `2026-05-23`, `2026-05`, `2026Q2`, and explicit ranges like `2026-05-01..2026-05-31`
- Filter autocomplete now suggests field names, MongoDB constructors like `ISODate(...)` and `ObjectId(...)`, and date shortcuts after fast-filter operators
- Reload a database to refresh its collection list from the server without reconnecting

### Fixed
- Opening Forge now targets the highlighted collection, reuses matching find-all queries, and preserves existing query drafts
- Running Forge queries or selected statements with keyboard shortcuts no longer causes a nested view-update crash
- Transfer cancellation now blocks reruns and mode changes until the active operation has stopped, preventing stale completion races
- macOS development runs use a stable Apple Development signature so Keychain access remains trusted across rebuilds
- Workspace restore no longer crashes by re-entering the sidebar while a connection event is being handled
- Workspace restore now waits for saved connection credentials to finish loading from Keychain before reconnecting
- Import and copy Clear/Drop operations now stage changes before atomic promotion, and Replace preserves failed originals while reporting partial progress
- Application read-only mode now blocks every app-owned write path, including AI and Forge, while destructive operations require frozen, revalidated confirmations
- Connection credentials now use versioned Keychain bundles; saved configuration and process arguments no longer expose URI secrets
- BSON import/export cancellation now terminates and waits for `mongodump` or `mongorestore`, and stale transfer completions are ignored
- Transfer filter, projection, and sort parsing now fails closed with field-specific errors instead of silently broadening queries
- JSON, CSV, Excel, report, aggregation, database-scope, and BSON exports now stage output atomically and preserve existing destinations on failure or cancellation
- CSV and Excel exports discover the complete schema and report late fields, row limits, string limits, and failed batches instead of silently dropping data
- Bulk Replace now performs ordered per-document replacements, preserves `_id`, supports cancellation, and reports exact partial execution
- Index replacement validates before dropping, restores the previous index on failure, and collection copy preserves supported index metadata
- Forge and BSON tools now reuse active SSH and SOCKS5 transports with their TLS and authentication options
- Query refresh now cancels actual client/server work rather than relying only on stale request IDs
- Numbered-tab, content-focus, document, and aggregation shortcuts no longer conflict; palette and menu shortcuts come from registered actions
- Palette Refresh now follows the same context-sensitive path as Cmd/Ctrl+R, AI opening focuses its input, and Forge preserves the selected collection
- Unit-test CI now runs the library tests instead of the zero-test binary target
- Search in JSON editors now wraps correctly in both directions — pressing Enter cycles forward through all matches, Shift+Enter cycles backward
- Detached editor windows now inherit the vibrancy setting from the main window instead of always appearing opaque
- Closing the main window now also closes all detached editor windows
- Cmd+W works reliably for successive tab closes — previously only the first press worked, then the shortcut stopped responding
- Table column order is now deterministic — columns sort alphabetically (_id always first) instead of depending on document key insertion order
- Table column widths no longer jump around when sorting or paginating — widths lock in on first render
- Explain modal no longer shows content scrolling behind it — backdrop opacity increased and scroll events are properly blocked
- Explain modal header is no longer semi-transparent
- Filter, sort, and projection inputs now have JSON syntax highlighting
- Sidebar typeahead now works regardless of which node type is selected (previously only worked with databases selected)
- Typeahead indicator dismisses on Enter (opens selection), Escape, and auto-clears after 1 second of inactivity
- Backspace deletes characters from the typeahead query
- Typeahead no longer opens collections during type-ahead — it only highlights; Enter opens
- Typeahead prefix match now stays on the current selection while the query still matches instead of jumping between similar names
- Pressing Backspace with the typeahead indicator active no longer triggers the delete confirmation dialog
- Preview tabs restored — single-clicking a collection opens an italic preview tab that gets replaced on the next click, matching VS Code behavior; previously every click opened a new permanent tab
- Arrow keys now work in the sidebar tree after clicking a collection (previously stopped responding due to focus loss)
- Applied fast filters now keep the text you typed instead of rewriting it into MongoDB JSON

### Changed
- Settings now use a searchable full-content tab with General, Transfer, AI Assistant, Agents & MCP, and Keybindings pages
- Connection management now uses a full-content singleton tab with explicit new-connection drafts, cancellation, draft-discard protection, and consistent New Connection entry points
- History now observes MongoDB changes passively and never pre-reads, authorizes, approves, or blocks originating writes
- Transfer now uses one compact Export, Import, and Copy workflow with progressive options and consistent aggregate progress across collection, database, JSON/CSV, and BSON operations
- Updates now require published SHA-256 assets, verify the downloaded archive and macOS code signature, respect the automatic-update preference, and install only after Restart to Update
- Update-check failures remain visible with Retry instead of silently returning to idle
- AI enablement now discloses the workspace metadata sent to the selected provider, and complete system prompts are no longer written to debug logs
- Transfer jobs that continue after errors retain failure counts, per-collection details, and processed-document totals
- Release workflows now publish per-archive SHA-256 checksum assets
- Filter bar redesigned — filter stays primary with parsed readback chips, while sort and projection live in the Options panel
- AI chat panel moved out of the documents view into its own dedicated space
- Close buttons on tabs now only appear on hover (except the active tab)
- Tab bar styling updated with padding and theme-aware background

### Security
- Agent sharing and direct write authority default off independently; application read-only mode always wins, protected or Production access requires an explicit warning, MCP cannot approve Arcula operations, and decrypted History payloads never leave the app
- Existing files, collections, and databases remain unchanged until destructive imports, copies, and exports complete successfully
- Write confirmations include the exact connection, namespace, filter or pipeline, current count, and frozen options being approved
- Plaintext credential export is disabled; connection export is redacted or passphrase-encrypted
- Update archives and final app bundles are verified before replacing the installed application

### Performance
- History uses one deployment-wide change stream per connection to avoid exhausting MongoDB connection pools, while large restores process independent documents concurrently and preserve same-document ordering
- Document tree (JSON view) expands and scrolls much faster on large or deeply nested documents — removed a quadratic dirty-check and the redundant full-tree clones that ran on every interaction
- Documents table is much smoother — it now re-renders only when the data or selection actually changes instead of rebuilding every visible cell every frame
- Aggregation results, schema view, and in-document search no longer redo expensive work (deep document clones, regex compilation, full schema re-walks) on every frame
- Sidebar search is much faster — results are cached and recomputed only when the query or the connection/database/collection list changes
- Per-collection caches are now freed when a tab closes, so memory no longer grows as you browse through many collections
- Copying a large multi-document selection no longer briefly freezes the UI

## [0.2.0] - 2026-03-05

### Added
- AI chat assistant with multi-provider support (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, Ollama)
- MongoDB-aware tool calls: find, aggregate, insert, update, delete, explain, indexes, schema inference, collection stats, and more
- Rich response blocks: data tables, charts, stats, and query previews
- AI completion suggestions in the documents view
- Secure API key storage via macOS Keychain
- Token budget tracking and safety guardrails for AI operations
- Model registry with per-provider model selection
- AI provider settings UI in the settings view
- Workspace and tab persistence for AI chat sessions

## [0.1.8] - 2026-02-25

### Added
- SSH tunnel support — connect to MongoDB through a bastion host with password or identity file auth, strict host key checking, and configurable local bind address
- SOCKS5 proxy support — route connections through a SOCKS5 proxy with optional credentials
- Connection import/export — back up, share, or migrate your saved connections as JSON. Three modes: Redacted (passwords stripped, safe to share), Encrypted (passwords locked with a passphrase via AES-256-GCM), or Plaintext. Import auto-renames duplicates and prompts for the passphrase when opening encrypted files.
- Schema Explorer tab — analyzes your collection's structure by sampling documents, showing a searchable field tree with types, presence rates, cardinality, polymorphism detection, and an inspector panel with charts and sample values
- Automatic background updates — new versions download silently and are ready to install on restart, VS Code style. Disable in Settings > Updates.
- Periodic update re-checks every 4 hours for long-running sessions.
- Multi-document selection in document lists.
- JSON editing now opens in a dedicated editor window, so you can browse and copy data while editing.
- JSON editor productivity shortcuts: move line, duplicate line, delete line, join lines, toggle comment, and format document.
- Clear inline status messages in the JSON editor for format/save/insert actions.
- Explain for queries and aggregation pipelines — click "Explain" next to Run to see the execution plan as a visual tree or raw JSON, with stage-level stats, index usage, cost indicators, and optimization suggestions.

### Fixed
- Re-opening Edit/Insert now focuses the existing editor window instead of creating duplicates.
- `Cmd/Ctrl+W` now closes the editor window instead of the main app tab.
- Save and Insert now close the editor window after a successful operation.
- Safer document saving: detects changed/deleted server documents and unapplied inline drafts, with recovery actions (`Reload`, `Load Inline Draft`, `Create as New`).
- Query text no longer clears when switching tabs.
- Preview tabs now promote/restore more consistently, including after restart.
- Inline field-edit save flow is more reliable.
- Typing around auto-paired characters in Forge is smoother.
- Format JSON no longer mangles non-English text (Georgian, Japanese, and other multi-byte characters come through intact now).
- "Create as New" actually creates a new document instead of failing with a duplicate key error every time.
- Typing non-English characters in query inputs no longer crashes the app.
- BSON export/import no longer fails when the connection URI contains a database name (e.g. `/admin` for auth) that differs from the target database.

### Changed
- Connection manager redesigned — 8 tabs consolidated to 4 (General, TLS, Network, Advanced), with a wider near-fullscreen dialog that gives fields more breathing room
- Pool & Timeouts and Compression settings are now tucked behind collapsible sections in the Advanced tab, keeping things clean until you need them
- Connection test now shows live progress steps instead of a generic spinner
- Tab switching is noticeably snappier — workspace state now saves with a debounce instead of blocking the UI on every switch
- Switching back to a previously-visited collection tab restores the document tree instantly from cache instead of rebuilding it from scratch
- Fewer unnecessary re-renders when switching tabs
- JSON editor window titles are now clearer and more descriptive.
- Clear shortcut for Forge output and aggregation stage is now `Cmd/Ctrl+Alt+K`.
- New app icons

## [0.1.7] - 2026-02-12

- Shift+Enter in query inputs to insert newlines with auto-indentation between braces
- Tab key accepts autocomplete suggestions in all code inputs
- In-document search (Cmd/Ctrl+F) with case-sensitive, whole word, regex, and values-only modes
- Expand All / Collapse All buttons for document trees, aggregation results, and Forge results
- Drag-and-drop tab reordering with scroll wheel support for overflowing tabs
- Pinnable result tabs in Forge shell to keep important results across runs
- Search and Format JSON buttons in JSON editing dialogs
